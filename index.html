          <h1>Technology in Motion</h1>
          <p>
            &emsp;Moore's Law has turned out to be true for more than just transistor counts. New technologies are always popping up,
            and some are revolutionizing industry, society, and our very culture. It's my mission to always stay on top of
            these developments and the use them to make more happen.
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp;A few of my favorite topics include: Linux, Free and Open Source Software, blockchain technology, networking, applied
            mathematics, and parallel computing.

          <h1>Getting My Hands Dirty</h1>
          <p>
            &emsp;The best way to learn is to jump in and break a few things. I always have at least a few projects on working on. From
            learning new technologies and languages, to developing websites (such as this one), to organizing community events;
            I love to go out and get things done.
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp;Check out my GitHub or stop by RIT during the semester to chat about something we can build together. Collaboration
            is key and I'd love to help!

        <a href="https://www.rit.edu/">
          <b>Rochester Institute of Technology</b>
        </a> is my home. I'm in the Computational Mathematics program and I can't say enough about how great it is! I've
        met so many talented engineers, artists, and scientists there that I've lost count.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.btcrit.com/">
          <b>Blockchain Technology Club</b>
        </a> at RIT is a great resource for learning more about Bitcoin and the technology behind it. I am the sitting treasurer
        and am active in organizing our events. Come to a meeting and see what the hype is about!
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.rochester.edu">
          <b>University of Rochester</b>
        </a> is the sixth-largest employer in New York State, but it's so much more than that. The heart of intellectual
        life in Western New York is home to many a great minds. Not only that, but they act as a center for the community,
        bringing together people from all walks of life. I'm incredibly grateful for the U of R's relationship with RIT,
        together we can do anything!
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.animalserviceleagueny.org/">
          <b>Animal Service League</b>
        </a> is an amazing orgaization dedicated to helping those who can't help themselves (and who are cute and fluffy).
        It's a great place to volunteer and I encourage everyone to give what they can.
